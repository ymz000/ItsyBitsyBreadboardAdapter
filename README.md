## Overview
The ItsyBitsy Breadboard Adapter is an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 Express-compatible piggyback module that converts the 3-sided pinout of the ItsyBitsy to dual in-line for use on typical solderless breadboards and soldered protoboards. The adapter was also designed with extra solderable pin connections and mounting ears for permanent installation.

Included is a level-shifted 4-pin JST STEMMA connector with jumper-selectable 5v or 3.3v power. The STEMMA interface can be configured to connect to the ItsyBitsy's UART (RX/TX) or I2C (SCL/SDA) signals. A 2-pin JST LiPo battery connection is on-board that supports charging (100mA charge rate), compatible with Adafruit's standard battery polarity.
