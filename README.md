## Overview
The ItsyBitsy Breadboard Adapter is an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4 Express-compatible piggyback module that converts the 3-sided pinout of the ItsyBitsy to dual in-line for use on standard solderless breadboards and typical soldered protoboards. The adapter was also designed with extra solderable pin connections and mounting ears for permanent installation.

Included is a 4-pin I2C STEMMA connector with jumper-selectable 5v or 3.3v power. A 2-pin battery connection is on-board, compatible with Adafruit battery polarity. This version of the adapter does not include a battery charger. J-TAG/SWD pins are available.
